Code functions as intended for most parts. Only thing that i found i just couldnt get to work were there asc and desc sort buttons, 
however you can sort by clicking the top of the row so they could be removed for redundancy. the show details button could be renamed 
or reworked, i expected upon clicking it to show the details of the currently
selected city, however it opens up to a seperate form that shows details for all cities and you manually scroll through each.
That in and of itself is a good way to do it, that way one doesnt have to back out and re click, i think i just expected it to
show details on what was selected inthe list, maybe id rename the button to show details page? over all though excellent job! =]
