Code Review – Ashley Smith (By Michael Lee)

I thought your code was clean and well-formed. Looks great! Everything works well and works elegantly for the given use case. My only real suggestion might be to consider using more methods, but with the simple requirements, that’s not a big deal. Also, maybe a bit more error handling just in case there are any issues loading/saving data.
